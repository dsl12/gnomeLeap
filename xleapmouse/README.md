This is a practical, usable mouse controller for the LeapMotion
controller, for Linux and X11.  This is vaguely based off my
fork/total rewrite of the PyLeapMouse finger controller (also
available on github).  This has the following features:

* **Motion**: Move your hand around with all fingers out, mouse moves.
  "Picking up" and "dropping" the cursor is easy, motion is relative.
  Jumping cursor has been minimized.
* **Clicking**: Clicking is possible by a gentle downward tapping of a
  finger, by default the index finger (left click) and thumb (right
  click).
* **Scrolling**: Scrolling can be accomplished by making a small
  circling motion with the index finger, if it's the only finger
  extended.  (Two fingers are actually allowed, since the thumb tends
  to stick out a bit.)
* **Pausing**: By extending only the pinky and making a "tap" motion
  toward the screen, xleapmouse will stop tracking movement, until the
  motion is made again to toggle it on.  Useful if you need to use a
  "real" mouse near the LeapMotion or gesticulate wildly.
* **GUI**: Optionally, with Qt 5.3+, a system tray icon and
  configuration GUI are available, similar to LeapMotion's
  configuration panel.  Full functionality is available without.
* **Responsive**: Written purely in C++, and very snappy.

## Building

This requires:

* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
* The LeapMotion **v2 beta** SDK.
* Reasonably new autotools (autoconf, automake)

Optionally:

* Qt 5.3+ with SDK (not just the libraries)

To build:

```console
$ ./autogen
Processing...
$ ./configure --with-qt5=/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
  <lots of stuff>
$ make
$ ./src/xleapmouse
```

The `--with-qt5` parameter is of course optional; if it can't find
Qt5's `qmake` by itself, or if you specify `--without-qt5`, it will be
built sans GUI.

If you *do* specify `--with-qt5=PATH`, **you must specify your
qmake**, and it will figure everything else out.

Note: *Build in the source directory*.  I like `build/` directories
too, but there's an automake bug which prevents it in this case.

## Running

Once you have a built `xleapmouse`, running it will start up with
defaults and write to `$HOME/.xleapmouse`.  You can alter the (saved)
configuration either with the GUI or with command-line options.

```console
Usage: xleapmouse [options...]

  -t, --track-finger N       Finger off which to track motion
  -T, --toggle-finger N      Finger which toggles tracking (screen tap)
  -s, --scroll-finger N      Finger which scrolls (circle motion)

  --lclick-fingers LIST      Finger(s) which left-click (default: 1 3)
  --mclick-fingers LIST      Finger(s) which middle-click (default: none)
  --rclick-fingers LIST      Finger(s) which right-click (default: 0)

Tracking:
  --distance-cutoff F        Minimum hand distance from sensor (default: 0.1)
  --base-scale F             Base speed (default: 10.0)
  --scale-factor F           Speed multiplier as hand moves toward sensor
                               (default: 30.0)
  --small-motion-cutoff F    Accumulate small motions larger than this
                               (default: 0.2)

Scrolling:
  --scroll-reverse (0|1)     Reverse scrolling directions
  --scroll-radius F          Minimum circle radius to register (default: 1.0)
  --scroll-delay F           Delay between scroll clicks (default: 0.2)

Clicking tweaks (see SDK for details):
  --kt-mindist F             Gesture.KeyTap.MinDistance        Default: 4.0
  --kt-hist F                Gesture.KeyTap.HistorySeconds     Default: 0.1
  --kt-mindown F             Gesture.KeyTap.MinDownVelocity    Default: 1.0

Tapping tweaks for toggle (see SDK for details):
  --st-minforward F          Gesture.ScreenTap.MinForwardVelocity
                               Default: 30.0
  --st-hist F                Gesture.ScreenTap.HistorySeconds  Default: 0.1
  --st-mindist F             Gesture.ScreenTap.MinDistance     Default: 1.0

Note: Fingers should be specified as a number, 0-4, or a space-
      separated list of numbers, e.g. --lclick-fingers "1 2"
```

## Q&A

**I ran it and I don't see anything.  Where's the GUI?**

This appears first as a tray icon you can right-click on.  Given you
need this for `LeapControlPanel`, you probably have it already.  If
not, and you're not running a desktop environment that has one
already, try [stalonetray](http://stalonetray.sourceforge.net/).

**I modified all the settings and it doesn't work very well!**

That's not a question, and the defaults are there for a reason.  Try
them first.  Delete your `~/.xleapmouserc` and start over.

**Will this replace my mouse?**

Doubtful unless you have a really steady hand.  I don't.  It's great
in conjunction with keyboard navigation for waving the cursor around
the screen like you have telekinesis, though.  I use sawfish along
with hotkeys assigned to packing and growing windows, and it works
pretty well.

Also it's great for browsing while you eat.  No getting food on the
mouse...

**No grabbing and dragging?!**

I might add it, but when I prototyped it with PyLeapMouse it just
didn't work very well.  More often than not windows would end up all
over and getting a good selection was impossible.

**No middle mouse clicking?**

You *can* configure this.  Use the GUI or `--mclick-fingers`.

Given middle mouse pastes in X, and the LeapMotion is often wont to
interpreting the slightest spurious motion in the worst possible way,
I don't use it myself.

**Why not Windows/OSX?**

This would probably be easy to port---even the GUI, which is Qt.  But
I don't have the time or knowledge.

Patches accepted!  But before you begin, let me know so I can abstract
out the mouse stuff slightly.

**This sucks and I hate it**

Go use something else.

**Your C++ sucks**

Probably!  Not my language of choice and I'm not terribly familiar.
Patches accepted, as long as they make things more maintainable (fewer
lines, easier comprehension, more flexibiliy) and don't break
anything.
